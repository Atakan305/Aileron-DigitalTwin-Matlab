# Aileron Digital Twin

This project aims to create a digital twin of an aircraft control surface called an aileron. A digital twin is a virtual model that utilizes mathematical and physical models to simulate the behavior of the actual aileron.

Indicated Aileron Model in Simscape can be downloaded from: https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38249-aileron-model-in-simscape  

## Installation

To use this project, you will need the latest version of MATLAB and Simulink. You can start by either cloning the project to your computer or downloading it as a ZIP archive.

1. To clone the project to your computer, run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/aileron-digital-twin.git
```

Alternatively, download the project and extract the ZIP archive.

2. Install and open the latest version of MATLAB and Simulink.

3. Navigate to the root directory of the project in the MATLAB command window:

```
cd aileron-digital-twin
```

4. Run the start file named `main.m`:

```
run main.m
```

This will create the aileron digital twin and start the simulation.

## Directory Structure

The project consists of the following main files and folders:

- `main.m`: The start file that initializes the project and creates the aileron digital twin.
- `.MAT Files/`: Folder containing workspace data of selected actuators of the aileron.
- `.fig files/`: Folder containing output graphs related to the project.
- `figures/`: Folder where simulation results and outputs are stored.
